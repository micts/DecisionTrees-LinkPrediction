### Abstract

In a group or a community where people interact and form associations with each other, it usually holds that the number of people that are connected is dramatically less than those that do not. Representing such a community as a social network, the aim is to predict those pairs of nodes that will connect in the future. This is known as the *Link Prediction* problem. Utilizing supervised learning, the latter can be phrased as binary classification. In this scheme, pairs of nodes that are connected represent the positive class, whereas those that do not correspond to the negative. Hence, there is a great imbalance between the two classes since the number of links that do not exist is overwhelmingly greater than those that do. Classification with imbalanced data can pose a problem because many algorithms tend to classify every observation in the majority class. In this paper, we apply Hellinger Distance Decision Trees (HDDT), which are considered to be skew insensitive and well suited for imbalanced data, to seven data sets constructed from five social networks. We compare HDDT to C4.5 which is the standard choice of decision trees in the machine learn-
ing community. We evaluate our results using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curve.
